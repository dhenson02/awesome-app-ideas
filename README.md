Stores people's preferences of toppings, and maybe crust styles too, i.e., what they like, love, dislike, hate, or are neutral to. (Alternate idea: store only the device owner's preferences, and several instances can communicate with each other to collaborate, filling in other people on an ad-hoc basis.) To put together an order, say who's there and how hungry. It should put together an order that will feed everybody, maximize happiness with the toppings, and minimize price. E.g., "1 medium half-pepperoni half-mushroom plus 2 large Hawaiians". It could get prices, and maybe locations, from assorted online sources TBD, or just make assumptions.

### Stack Exchange Client

### ToDo List (Classic)

### Wine cellar (wine manager)

### Working parents dinner app
